## Infrastructure as Code with Pulumi

Pulumi is a modern **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** platform that enables you to define, deploy, and manage cloud infrastructure using familiar programming languages. Pulumi simplifies cloud resource management, offering a flexible and secure approach for automating infrastructure while integrating seamlessly with development workflows.

Pulumi is free, open source, and can optionally integrate with the Pulumi Cloud for enhanced management, collaboration, and monitoring of your infrastructure.

### Getting Started

1. **Install Pulumi CLI**:  
   Download and install the Pulumi CLI for your platform from [Pulumi Downloads](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/get-started/install/).

2. **Set Up Your Environment**:

    - Authenticate with your preferred cloud provider (e.g., `aws configure` for AWS).
    - Install the programming language runtime for your project (e.g., Node.js for TypeScript).

3. **Create a New Project**:

    ```bash
    pulumi new <template>
    ```

    Replace `<template>` with your preferred stack, such as `aws-typescript` or `azure-python`.

4. **Define Your Infrastructure**:  
   Write your infrastructure code in the `index.ts` file or the main entry point for your selected language.

5. **Preview and Deploy Changes**:

    - Preview changes:
        ```bash
        pulumi preview
        ```
    - Deploy your infrastructure:
        ```bash
        pulumi up
        ```

6. **Manage Stacks**:  
   Use stacks to manage multiple environments (e.g., `dev`, `staging`, `prod`).

    ```bash
    pulumi stack init dev
    ```

7. **Destroy Resources**:  
   Remove all resources when no longer needed to save costs.
    ```bash
    pulumi destroy
    ```

### Examples

#### Create an S3 Bucket in AWS (TypeScript)

```typescript
import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";

const bucket = new aws.s3.Bucket("my-bucket", {
    acl: "private",
    tags: {
        Environment: "Dev",
        Project: "PulumiExample",
    },
});

export const bucketName = bucket.id;
```
